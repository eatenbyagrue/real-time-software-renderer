# Simple rasterizer, written in just C++, using SDL to write to the screen

This is a simple rasterizer for 3D mesh data, with the intention to get myself familiar with 3D and
C++ programming. The idea is to not use any graphics libraries like Open GL, and implement
supplementary libraries to deal with linear algebra by myself, too.

I mostly follow this book by Gambetta for the time being (https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/).
